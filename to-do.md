## Assumptions
1. Books contain the right information (e.g. valid formats)

## Need to change
1. change if statements to else-if in console, or find a more elegant way to achieve this. Would switch statement be valid in this case?

## Need to test
1. Haven't quite figured out how to test calling the console method processUserInput() recursively e.g. so a user can input the wrong thing more than once without causing a failing test because it never times out waiting for user input...

## Future direction
1. Use CSV and read from that to insert books into library
